# Envtea - The best tool for setting up your environment.
From basic system maintenance tasks to setting up LAMP, this tool is what developers always wanted.

# But, Why Envtea?
The biggest reason is it saves a lot of time. Imagine this: you bought a server, and you installed Debian 12 on it. Nice! But now, you have to set up any of your services like SSH, Python, text editors and other utilities...

So time wasting, right? Exactly.
